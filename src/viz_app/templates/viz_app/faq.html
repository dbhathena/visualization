                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Which data is recorded with the Empatica E4 senosr?</span>
                <br>
                The E4 sensor from Empatica measures (1) skin conductance, (2) skin temperature, (3) heart rate, and (4)
                3-axis acceleration data. More information can be found
                <a class="text-link" href="https://www.empatica.com/research/e4/">here</a>.

            <li>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">How is the E4 sensor data collected?</span>
                <br>
                The E4 sensors were worn continuously by the participants for 8 weeks on both wrists. The measurements
                were uploaded regularly (~every 24 hours) to the Empatica server.

        <h2>Mobile Phone Data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Which information was collected from phones?</span>
                <br>
                The app collected:
                <ol>
                    <li>Timing and sender or recipient phone numbers of calls and text messages</li>
                    <li>Timing of screen on/off</li>
                    <li>Location</li>
                    <li>Timing of application use and the name of application process</li>
                    <li>Device information (e.g. phone type, WiFi/Bluetooth mac address, etc.)</li>
                </ol>
                We did <b>not</b> record SMS messages, phone conversations, internet browsing history, or which keys were
                pressed on the phone.

            <li>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">How is the mobile phone data collected?</span>
                <br>
                All the collected data is encrypted on the phone and then sent to the server using the movisensXS app.
                More information can be found <a class="text-link" href="https://xs.movisens.com/">here</a>.

            <li>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">How confidential is the mobile phone data?</span>
                <br>
                Software on the mobile phones would automatically de-identify the collected data by encrypting all
                the to/from phone numbers and sender/recipient names.

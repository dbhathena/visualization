    <ul>
        <li>
            <p  style='font-family:arimobold'>Which data is recorded with the Empatica E4 sensor?</p>
            The E4 sensor from Empatica measures (1) skin conductance, (2) skin temperature, (3) heart rate, and (4)
            3-axis acceleration data. More information can be found
            <a class="text-link" href="https://www.empatica.com/research/e4/">here</a>.

        <br>
        <li>
            <p  style='font-family:arimobold'>How is the E4 sensor data collected?</p>
            The E4 sensors were worn continuously by the participants for 8 weeks on both wrists. The measurements
            were uploaded regularly (~every 24 hours) to the Empatica server.

  <div class="subtext">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p  style='font-family:arimobold'>Which information was collected from phones?</p>
            The app collected:
            <ol style='margin-left:0;'>
                <li>Timing and sender or recipient phone numbers of calls and text messages</li>
                <li>Timing of screen on/off</li>
                <li>Location</li>
                <li>Timing of application use and the name of application process</li>
                <li>Device information (e.g. phone type, WiFi/Bluetooth mac address, etc.)</li>
            </ol>
            We did <b style='font-family:arimobold'>not</b> record SMS messages, phone conversations, internet browsing history, or which keys were
            pressed on the phone.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <p  style='font-family:arimobold'>How is the mobile phone data collected?</p>
            All the collected data is encrypted on the phone and then sent to the server using the movisensXS app.
            More information can be found <a class="text-link" href="https://xs.movisens.com/">here</a>.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <p  style='font-family:arimobold'>How confidential is the mobile phone data?</p>
            Software on the mobile phones would automatically de-identify the collected data by encrypting all
            the to/from phone numbers and sender/recipient names.
